                    Welcome, to a site dedicated to Star Wars. At this moment on
                    the site you will find information about several movies,
                    planets, characters and starships. The site will continue to
                    grow. Eventually, the site should have more than a dozen
                    planets, characters and starships, as well as a comment
                    system. The site uses the Star Wars API https://swapi.dev/.
